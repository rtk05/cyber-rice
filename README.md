## cyber-rice
This is a shitty userstyle for 8chan that is based on the color schemes of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. It was originally designed for the /cyber/ board but oddly works on every board except /cyber/.

## Installation
Just copy the contents of rice into a new stylish style or any other userstyle extension.
